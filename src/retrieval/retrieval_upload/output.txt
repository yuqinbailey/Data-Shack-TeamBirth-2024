Think all nurses should be on the same page here otherwise such a great experience.
Also very educated and responsible care.
Staff in general was very patient, helpful with fears and confusion.
Our only feedback would be to not discharge people without requesting the forms for a birth certificate to be dropped off. We only saw the WA birth statistics/ form in the papers provided once at home which meant that we had to return to the hospital a few days later to drop it off and be able to apply for a birth certificate.
